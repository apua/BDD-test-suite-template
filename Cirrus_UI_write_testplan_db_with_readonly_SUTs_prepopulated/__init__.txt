#   is to execute test cases that write to testplan db
#   to test testplan db related function.
#   Example test cases in this suite such as Edit Test Plan, Delete Test Plan, ...etc.
#   Test suite setup: Before running test cases, the default test SUTs from
#   testdata/test_testplan2.json will be imported into hwdb.
#   Test suite teardown: After completing all test cases, suite teardown will
#   delete the imported SUTs from hwdb.
#   Testers write test cases in this suite should use following keywords 
#   to add test plan with random generated name.
#   By REST call api:
#       ${tp}=    Get Data From JSON And Assign Testplan Name   edit_test_plan.json
#       Import Test Plans Via REST  ${tp}
#   By Selenium:
#       ${testplan name}=   Get Random Word
#       Save Test Plan As ${testplan name}
